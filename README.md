smsmail
=======

`smsmail` is a program which runs a single-threaded "daemon" which watches
an email inbox for messages from my (now defunct) Verizon cell phone 
number (sent via SMS-to-email gateay).

It is one of the very first Python programs I ever wrote, circa November 2005.

As you can see, I primarily used it to control XMMS by way of text message.
