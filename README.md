smsmail
=======

`smsmail` is a program which runs a single-threaded "daemon" which watches
an email inbox for messages from my (now defunct) Verizon cell phone 
number (sent via SMS-to-email gateay).

## Background

`smsmail` is one of the very first Python programs I ever wrote, circa November 2005.

Things were different then
AJAX and RSS feeds roamed the blogosphere

We were young, but we fell in love
I had been 16 years old for just two months

Once we started neither of could stop
We've been programming together ever since
I love Python and think I always will
